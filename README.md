Project 1: Build a Single Screen App

Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

Your design must include:

● Business name

● At least one photo representing the business

● Two or more other pieces of information, such as:

    ○ Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
  
     ○ Address of the Business
  
     ○ Description of business
  
     ○ Hours of operation
